# Eat Complete
This is a website that allows users to choose a restaurant to eat at. 

It begins on home page where the user can either enter a location to search from or use their current location. They can also choose to enter a category of restaurants, where a list of available restaurants is linked, or search for all restaurants, by leaving the field blank. 

After these initial choices, the user is taken to a screen where they can click find restaurants to begin their search for a restaurant to eat it. After clicking this button, the first ten restaurants are displayed on the map and in a table to the left of the map. The user can therefore see basic information about the restaurant, including name, phone number, rating, price, and location, along with a map that displays the location of the restaurant. The user can click find restaurants again for more options. If the user wants to search for a different category of restaurants or in a different location, they can click restart search to start over.

I used Yelp's API to search for businesses based on some search criteria, including latitude, longitude, limit, and categories. I also used the Google Maps API to display a map with the different business represented by markers. I also used the API to convert cities and zip codes to latitude and longitude coordinates.
